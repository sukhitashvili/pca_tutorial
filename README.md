# PCA From Scratch 

[pca.ipynb](https://github.com/sukhitashvili/pca_tutorial/blob/master/pca.ipynb) file contains PCA algorithm implementation using only simple matrix-vector operations, like multiplication and subtraction.

The algorithm is similar to SK-Learn's implementation. The [pca.ipynb](https://github.com/sukhitashvili/pca_tutorial/blob/master/pca.ipynb) notebook contains all the necessary code and comparison with SK-Learn's implementation using [Iris dataset](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fscikit-learn.org%2F1.4%2Fauto_examples%2Fdatasets%2Fplot_iris_dataset.html).
